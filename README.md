# Number Base Converter

In daily life, we mostly use the decimal numeral system, but still, there are many other ways to represent numbers. For example, when working with computers, you'll probably deal with binary, octal, and hexadecimal numbers. It's really nice to have a tool that can help you easily and correctly convert numbers from one system to another.

If the user needs to restart the program each time after converting just one number, it is very inconvenient. I fixed that and made my program prompt the user for more numbers until the user is ready to quit.

Also, I added the reverse conversion: from binary, octal, and hexadecimal systems to decimal. Converting from octal, hexadecimal, or any other system to decimal works almost the same way as with binary numbers, only the base is different.

The possible commands are /from, /to, and /exit.
